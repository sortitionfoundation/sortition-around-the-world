Here are some more details on each evaluation method: 1) Participant exit survey: Anonymous evaluation forms were filled by citizen participants once a day on multiple questions (assessing how they felt, the quality of information brought to them, several questions on the work in small groups, the planning of each day). Every morning, a moderator synthetised the evaluations and signaled how organisers, resource persons and panelist citizens could take key elements from the evaluations into account. In the end, questions were also asked on how the panel possibly modified participants' views on the themes of the panel, and on their interest about participation in public decision-making. As it was the first citizens' jury/panel in Belgium (first citizens' deliberation based on randomly selected citizens, getting access to a balanced panel of stakeholders and experts), a developmental evaluation modus was decided ('ongoing' evaluation that steers social innovation processes in real time). The resource persons (experts, stakeholders bringing information to the panelists also took part to the evaluation through exit surveys, although with different questions. 2) Process reflexion by the organisers: A detailed 'vade-mecum' on the whole initiative and process was made public, to help organise similar initiatives in the future. 3) Participant feedback session: On 7 December 2001, more than 6 months after delivering their citizen report, panelist citizens came back together to review the initiative.","Lessons learned from the initiative and its evaluation are synthetised in the vade-mecum, there is not enough space here to sum them up.

and the capacity of the participating citizens to represent the views of the broader
‘uninformed’ community.  Most elected representatives did not appreciate the deliberative and educational
contribution of mini-publics. In particular there were misunderstandings about how the
process worked and at times the scientific language appeared to distract and be unhelpful. The broader democratic potential of mini-publics tends to be under-valued or underappreciated by elected representatives. ","1. Elected officials are more supportive of mini-publics once they have had the
opportunity to observe and experience a deliberative process involving everyday citizens. 2. Mini-publics enable MPs to hear from a broader set of publics than they would
normally hear from, which is crucial when they are deliberating on policy issues of state or
national significance. 3. Successful mini-publics need a committed champion who can work closely with
the conveners, and communicate with any sceptical parties. 4. Independent and non-partisanship organisations, such as newDemocracy, play a
vital role in instigating and convening mini-publics, especially in highly politicised contexts. 5. To minimise confusion and misinterpretation, the use of scientific language
should be minimised when describing mini-publics, particularly when referring to the
selection process and the ‘representativeness’ of the participating citizens. 6. Effort should go into demonstrating that everyday citizens do care about complex
issues, and want to participate in their governance. 7. There is a need to understand further the resistance of MPs to devolving or
sharing power. ",,,"Funded by The newDemocracy Foundation and donors, supported by volunteer facilitators",Face-to-face,,,,,,checked

It was a multi-step process that lasted for four months:
1. first proposals were crowd sourced on the platform (using the Icelandic Citizen Foundations' freeware)
2. then the collected ideas were grouped and analysed by experts, and the structured recommendations were discussed and voted upon in thematic seminars
3.  18 proposals were discussed upon at the Deliberation Day where more than 300 randomly selected persons decided to present to the Parliament of Estonia 15 proposals.

That is why scenarios were developed on this complex issue, to help bring a wide number of facts, trends, figures and analysis into sevarl contrasting, but coherent, visions of the future. 2) While the commissioning public and private partners were very interested into the citizens report and process, the underlying issues addressed by the panel are major and politically sensitive (pension system, health system, employment, solidarity, inequalities, etc.). The panel approached these issues in a creative and rather systemic way, integrating them in a global vision. The public decision-making system in Belgium has difficulty in dealing with these issues, and even more so in integrating them together. For example, the reform of the pension system is an issue with multiple consequences and is politically highly charged. Constantly postponed, its reform has not yet taken place, contrary to what was announced at the time of the panel, except for certain aspects (the retirement age was delayed in the next government).

In 2008 it was decided that the parliamentarians would henceforth be given the maximum lump sum for the statutory pension insurance of around 1,500 euros (today: 1,720 euros) for building up private old-age insurance. This was changed again in a shortened parliamentary procedure. After considerable public criticism, the state parliament of Baden-Württemberg withdrew this decision - it remained with the private, subsidized old-age provision. Based on the recommendations of an expert group that had been advised by the citizens' foru, it changed the system to a Pensions Fund.","Yes, an expert group","Academics,NGO's",Oversight,https://www.landtag-bw.de/home/der-landtag/gremien/fruhere-ausschusse-16-wp/kommission--burgerforum/burgerforum.html,2017,Germany,Yes,Regional/State,"Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany",Translake,https://www.translake.org/,Private sector,Public spending,,1,27,Two-stage random selection (e.g. civic lottery),"The company “Bamberger Center for Empirical Studies” ( https://www.uni-bamberg.de/zentren/baces/ ) commissioned with the random selection of the participants used two different samples. The first, significantly larger, sample consisted of randomly generated landline connections according to the Gabler-Häder method, which was provided by GESIS - Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences in Mannheim. The second sample consisted of private individuals' mobile phone numbers listed in the Baden-Württemberg telephone directory.
 
The total of 26 067 telephone numbers from both samples were called by the BACES interviewers with the support of a computer-assisted telephone system. If a person was reached by phone, the employee of the recruiting company introduced himself as an employee of BACES and as a contractor of the Independent Commission of the State Parliament of Baden-Württemberg and explained the key data of the project in terms of both content and organization.
 
If the person called expressed interest in the Citizens 'Forum, he was sent a cover letter containing the essential information about the Citizens' Forum (e.g. background of the Citizens 'Forum, the core of the proposed and canceled changes to the pension scheme for MPs at the beginning of 2017, place and time of the Citizens' Forum , Travel expenses and daily allowance) as well as a registration form with the request for a binding registration. 
 
BACES collected these registrations and evaluated them according to the specified quotas (age, gender, administrative district). If a registration fit into the open quotas, the person received a confirmation of participation, otherwise they were informed that they would be placed on a waiting list. In this way, BACES ultimately selected 27 participants from the four administrative districts and with different socio-demographic characteristics.","Phone,Post",Parliament,,,,,Public Officials,"To get feedback and information about the subject, directly impacting MPs",,,"Regional media, parliaments website
