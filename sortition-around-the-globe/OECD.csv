and the capacity of the participating citizens to represent the views of the broader
‘uninformed’ community.  Most elected representatives did not appreciate the deliberative and educational
contribution of mini-publics. In particular there were misunderstandings about how the
process worked and at times the scientific language appeared to distract and be unhelpful. The broader democratic potential of mini-publics tends to be under-valued or underappreciated by elected representatives. ","1. Elected officials are more supportive of mini-publics once they have had the
opportunity to observe and experience a deliberative process involving everyday citizens. 2. Mini-publics enable MPs to hear from a broader set of publics than they would
normally hear from, which is crucial when they are deliberating on policy issues of state or
national significance. 3. Successful mini-publics need a committed champion who can work closely with
the conveners, and communicate with any sceptical parties. 4. Independent and non-partisanship organisations, such as newDemocracy, play a
vital role in instigating and convening mini-publics, especially in highly politicised contexts. 5. To minimise confusion and misinterpretation, the use of scientific language
should be minimised when describing mini-publics, particularly when referring to the
selection process and the ‘representativeness’ of the participating citizens. 6. Effort should go into demonstrating that everyday citizens do care about complex
issues, and want to participate in their governance. 7. There is a need to understand further the resistance of MPs to devolving or
sharing power. ",,,"Funded by The newDemocracy Foundation and donors, supported by volunteer facilitators",,
